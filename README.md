I am a bangalore-based software engineer and leader.

My passion is in building and improving processes that enable teams to move faster, better, and happier.

Also, I enjoy learning about Programming and applying it to solve real world problems.

That said, I believe there is no better tool for quickly iterating a new web project than Ruby on Rails, which Iâ€™ve been using on and off for years.
